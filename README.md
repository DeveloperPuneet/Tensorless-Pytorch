# Tensorless PyTorch

Tensorless PyTorch is a lightweight toolkit for turning ordinary text and
tabular data into portable PyTorch models with minimal setup. It supports text
generation, text classification, tabular classification, and regression.

The distribution is installed as `tensorless-pytorch`; the stable Python import
remains `tensorless` for compatibility.

## Install

```bash
pip install tensorless-pytorch
```

## Train on your data

```python
import tensorless as tl

model = tl.train("./corpus.txt", task="text-generation")
print(model.generate("The", max_new_tokens=40))
```

Text files are trained as next-token language models. BPE is the default
tokenizer; use `tokenizer="char"` for a character-level model. Tensorless PyTorch
derives model size, batch size, epochs, validation, device, and BPE vocabulary
size from the data, while every setting can be overridden.

Long text is tokenized lazily and fed through PyTorch in fixed-size batches.
CUDA training automatically uses `fp16` or `bf16` when supported, including
gradient scaling and checkpointed scaler state. Reduce `batch_size` if memory
is limited.

## English starter pretraining

```python
import tensorless as tl

model = tl.pretrain(out="english.tl", epochs=20, max_seq_len=128)
print(model.generate("A complete sentence", max_new_tokens=30))
```

This offline starter corpus contains English prose and grammar examples. It is
for demos and smoke tests, not a replacement for a large language dataset. For
real pretraining, pass your own `.txt` corpus to `tl.train()` and increase the
training settings as your hardware allows.

## Other tasks

```python
tl.train("reviews/", task="text-classification")
tl.train("housing.csv", task="regression")
```

Tabular preprocessing automatically handles numeric values, ISO dates, and
high-cardinality categories. Missing and rare values are handled using the
fitted training data, and the same preprocessing is stored in the `.tl` file.

Models are saved as `.tl` files and can be loaded later:

```python
model = tl.load("model.tl")
print(model.info())
```

mixed precision, checkpointing, and the command-line interface.
